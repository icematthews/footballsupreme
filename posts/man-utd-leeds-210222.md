On a wet and soggy pitch against a lower-quality team, United proved their doubters wrong, although they almost let it slip. Harry Maguire opened the scoring with a header from a corner after a tense half an hour. Before half time, Victor Lindelof, unopposed by Leeds' defenders, ran towards the edge of the box and passed to Jadon Sancho who dinked over to Bruno Fernandes to make the score 2-0 before half-time. After the break, Rodrigo Moreno capitalized on Bruno's misplaced pass to Jesse Lingard with an unintended goal that was meant to be a cross into the box. A minute later, Daniel James' brilliant pass to Raphinha inside the box made the score 2-2. 

Staring at an unacceptable draw, Ralf Rangnick's decison to bring in Fred and Anthony Elanga instantly changed the game. Fred's one-two with Sancho, which was orchestrated by Bruno and then Cristiano Ronaldo inside Leeds' box, had the Brazilian made the score 3-2. Bruno killed the game off with some impressive individual skill in front of Leeds' box to pass to an unmarked Elanga who then made the score 4-2. While there were positives in the game, United cannot afford to be complacent and must not ensure a repeat of the defensive mishaps in future games as they may not find a way back against better teams.
