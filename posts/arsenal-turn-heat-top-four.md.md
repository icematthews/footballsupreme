The race for Champions League football next season is heating up with Harry Kane-led Tottenham Hotspur showing some serious fight by beating current champions Manchester City. Dejan Kulusevski opened the scoring for the Lilywhites before Ilkay Gundogan grabbed the equalizer for the Citizens. Harry Kane put the visitors back in front after the start of the second half but Spurs gave away a late penalty. Riyad Mahrez equalized from the spot but Kane headed in a last-minute winner to keep their top 4 hopes alive.

Arsenal strolled over Brentford in an important game for Mikel Arteta's men. Goals by Emile Smith-Rowe and Bukayo Saka sealed the three points for the Gunners as they go head to head with Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur for 4th place. Leading up to the Battle of the Emirates on April 23, United have tougher fixtures as they will have to face Manchester City on March 7, Tottenham Hotspur on March 13 and Liverpool on March 21 while Arsenal only have to play Liverpool on March 17. Both Arsenal and Man Utd will also have to face Chelsea before the season ends. On the other hand, Tottenham Hotspur looks to have the easiest set of fixtures as they only have to face Man Utd on March 13 and Liverpool on May 7. Nevertheless, anything can happen and fingers will be crossed on which of the three teams will blink first.
