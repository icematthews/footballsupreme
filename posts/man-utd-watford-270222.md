## 

United started promisingly but missed glaring chances in front of goal. Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes wasted easy chances to score in the first half and United had to pay the price. The second half was even worse as players such as Paul Pogba looked tired and the whole attack became blunted. Draws against Burnley, Southampton and Watford has look to cost United the fight for Champions League football next season and unless United produce a miracle against Man City, Tottenham, Liverpool and most importantly Arsenal, the dream of getting top 4 looks impossible now. All eyes are on Arsenal on whether they can sustain their performances until the end of the season.
